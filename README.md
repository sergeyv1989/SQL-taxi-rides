# Taxi transportation querying

In this project I query a database with data on taxi rides in Chicago.

The database contains 4 tables, with information on the rides, the cabs, the neighborhoods and the weather conditions.

The goal is to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. In particular, after a few queries for exploratory data analysis, I test the hypothesis that the duration of rides from the the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Sundays.
